```
git clone https://github.com/kwanhlee/Rufus.git
```

## Usage
1. After cloning the repository, change directory ("cd") into the repository

 For example: If the path of the repository is /Desktop/Rufus
```
cd Desktop/Rufus
```
 2. activate the Python environment
```
source env/bin/activate
```
3. Now run the command with your repository path as the argument.
